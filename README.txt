Rules and How to Play:
All players will be separated into different factions: Town, Mafia, Coven, Neutral Evil, and Neutral.
The Town's goal is to either defeat the Ender Dragon or kill all Evil roles.
The Mafia, Coven, and Neutral Evil's goal is to eliminate the Town and other Evils not in their faction.
Neutral roles have varying win conditions that encourage cooperation with either the Town or Evil factions.

Each player has one life.  All death messages are replaced with "*player* has died".
The game ends when the Town or an Evil faction has won.

Triggers:
/trigger khaos.give_role - hand out roles to every player online
/trigger khaos.start_game - starts the game
/trigger khaos.reset - resets all roles and scoreboards
