Cora:
- added global variable scoreboard to keep track of different numbers
- added global loop scoreboard to keep track of loops
- added reset trigger
- added random_50 predicate which returns true 50% of the time
- added faction loot table which returns
    white_wool 50%,
    orange_wool 28.6%,
    magenta_wool 28.6%,
    light_blue_wool 14.3%,
    yellow_wool 28.6%
- added town_win_condition advancment which triggers khaos:game_state_handling/town_win_condition
  when ender dragon is killed by a player in the khaos.town team
- procrastinated implementing actually useful stuff so added generate_death_message_array,
  get_death_message_array, and loop_death_message into roles/jester

Notes:
Idea for role distribution-
  create int array of size num players
  generate invisible armor stand
  execute as armor_stand run loot replace entity @s weapon.mainhand loot khaos:faction
  detect item in mainhand, output 0 if white_wool, 1 if orange_wool, 2 if magenta_wool, 3 if light_blue, and 4 if yellow
  randomly generate numbers to fill up the array using loot table
  0 = good, 1 = mafia, 2 = coven, 3 = neutral evil, 4 = neutral
  select random player and give role based off number in first element of array, remove first element of array, loop

  in future add town, mafia, coven, neutral_evil, and neutral loot tables

  to ensure a fair and playable game we can check how many evil roles are added, if its 0 or exceeds 50% of num players,
  then we can try generating again before giving the roles to players
