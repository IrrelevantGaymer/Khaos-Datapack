Ideas in the future:
  - Add /trigger khaos.settings
  - Different gamemodes with different role distributions
  - Maybe a Stalemate timer to promote early killing
  - Nomad gamemode? Having a moving worldborder that always has a stronghold inside it
    to keep players on the move
  - Gamemodes where the goal isn't to kill the dragon, maybe kill the wither,
    or get all advancements, or only eliminate the evil roles???
  - New function in jester which sends a message checking if the jester died in the way
    they were supposed to before letting them haunt someone, because checking how someone died
    is really hard
  - Add an advancement when the player takes damage, an x, y, and z scoreboards
    will be updated with that players last coords, meaning when they die and become
    a spectator, we can teleport them to where they died
    (could also be useful for vampire conversion)
  - Summon fireworks at winning players after a win condition???
  - For Roles with random win conditions (Jester, Executioner, etc.),
    have different assign functions: assign_random for assign_roles function,
    and assign so that a Judge can use execute as Player run function khaos:roles/.../assign
    so they can make a custom game with specific roles and win conditions
  - Having issues coming up with a way to use the tellraw commands, could replace it with
    filling
